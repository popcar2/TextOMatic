# The Text-O-Matic 2000
Welcome to the most ameteur yet cool project on GitHub. For behold! This is... The TEXT-O-MATIC 2000! Coded in Monogame.

#...What?
The Text-O-Matic 2000 is a program that allows you to create text based adventures through text files! Simple to use, I think, and will supposedly have some kind of editor soon.
When you finish making a text based adventure, just tell your friend buddy to replace their script folder with yours. Instant adventures awaits!

#Sign me up. Where do I get this?
I mean I don't have a website or anything, but there will soon be a discord server detailing my development. It won't always be about this project because I like messing around alot. You could probably see me creating some kind of space crab bullet hell game.
To get the most recent stable build, use this mediafire link: https://www.mediafire.com/?bibc22l2bxyy6ym
Just extract and play.
