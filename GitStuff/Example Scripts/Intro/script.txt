//CHEAT SHEET:
// Every new line in the txt file is a new line in the program. There is a small pause after every line.
// // is a comment.
// -- does not make a new line
// (text) | (number)  makes a delay after typing the text. It's measured in miliseconds
// CLEAR removes all text on screen
// CLEARBUTTONS removes all text on buttons and deactivates them
// \n creates a new line (useful for continuing text without pausing)
// BUTTONTEXT1 (text)  puts text on button 1 and activates it
// IFBUTTON1 (number)  Will stop typing and wait. The number determines which choice number it is, starting from 1.
//                     If activated, it will read all text under the IFBUTTON command.
//                     If you hit an IFBUTTON, the choice number will automatically be set to that if's choice number.
// CHOICE (number)  sets your choice number. Use only in the last IFBUTTON. Try to mimic what I'm doing here to avoid issues.
//                     Make IFBUTTONs with the same choice number to provide multiple choices for the same prompt!
// I added a slight pause before starting because the game reads 1 line every frame. Sometimes too many comments
// can make the program skip the first line.
// MAINMENU   Goes back to main menu.

popcar2: I mean, really, you probably already know that.
popcar2: Anyways, welcome, and stuff.
popcar2: So... You can easily create an adventure like this. The text edit feature is still in the works.
popcar2: Also, there's no music sadly. But hey, pre-set music can ruin the immersion, right?
popcar2: If I add elevator music, it won't mix well with horror stories.
popcar2: Anyways... What do you think so far? Are you interested?

popcar2: Good. I don't really have a text based adventure to show you, but this is close enough.
popcar2: You're gonna have to write your own!
popcar2: To start, go to the game directory and open the folder called "Script".
popcar2: There will be a text file called script.txt . It's where you can type your stuff!
popcar2: Any questions?

popcar2: It's really simple. The script file including this has everything you need to know.
popcar2: If that still doesn't explain well, there's another script file inside another folder\ncalled The Fausto Adventures.
popcar2: It's full of inside jokes and people you wouldn't know but I think it'll help to see examples.
popcar2: Anything else you want to know?

popcar2: There are a couple, but most of them are unimportant.
popcar2: An example of an unimportant one would be if you clicked a button in the main menu before it finished\ntyping its text, it'd skip the first line of the file.
popcar2: An important glitch right now is that sometimes a line of text would skip if there wasn't a long enough\npause, it'd skip the next line of text.
popcar2: If you encounter this glitch, just add a small delay to the line.
